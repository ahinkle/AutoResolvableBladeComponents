Automatically resolve your Blade Component views based on the component class names to allow for cleaner components.

This package was built on common architecture patterns between Laravel Components and Livewire Components. Livewire automatically resolves the Blade Views whereas Laravel Components do not and require the `render()` method. This simple but useful package solves that.

```php
<?php

namespace App\View\Components;

use Ahinkle\AutoResolvableComponents\AutoResolvableComponent;

class Alert extends AutoResolvableComponent
{
    //
}
```

Will automatically render the view: `components.alert`.


## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require ahinkle/auto-resolvable-blade-components
```
